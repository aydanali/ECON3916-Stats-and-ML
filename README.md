# ECON3916-Stats-and-ML
📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio
Welcome! I'm Aydan, a third-year Economics major with a Data Science minor at Northeastern University. This repository showcases my journey in ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with modern computational methods.
👤 About Me
I'm passionate about applying rigorous quantitative methods to real-world economic problems. With experience as a Commercial Analyst at Wayfair and Data Analytics Intern at Accelerate Prosperity, I'm actively seeking opportunities in economic consulting, strategy consulting, and venture capital where I can leverage both economic intuition and technical skills to drive data-informed decisions.
Currently serving as Co-President of the Economics Society at Northeastern, I'm committed to building the bridge between classical economic thinking and the data science toolkit that modern analysts need.
📁 About This Portfolio
This repository documents my coursework applying a "Concept Extension" framework—taking foundational statistical and econometric concepts and scaling them using machine learning algorithms.
Core Philosophy:

Start with traditional methods (OLS regression, hypothesis testing)
Extend to ML algorithms (Lasso, Ridge, Random Forests)
Maintain economic interpretation and causal reasoning throughout

The goal isn't just prediction—it's about combining causal inference with predictive analytics to answer meaningful economic questions. Each project demonstrates how modern computational tools can enhance, not replace, economic theory.

🎯 What I'm Learning

Regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) for high-dimensional economic data
Cross-validation and model selection strategies
Ensemble methods and tree-based models
Balancing prediction accuracy with economic interpretability
Translating ML outputs into actionable economic insights

📫 Connect With Me
I'm always eager to discuss economics, data science, and their intersection. Feel free to explore my work and reach out!
